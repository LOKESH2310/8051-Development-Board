## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-cycle embedded system design around the **AT89C51RC2 (8051)** microcontroller. The board was built from scratch, covering hardware prototyping, memory decoding, serial interfaces, and firmware development in **C and Assembly**. It serves as an educational platform to learn low-level embedded design and system bring-up techniques.
